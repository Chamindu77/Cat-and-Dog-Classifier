## Introduction
This project aims to build a classifier capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. The model architecture includes convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, dropout, batch normalization, and fully connected layers. The dataset is preprocessed, augmented, and split into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model.
